# easy-text-editor
My first standalone application with a GUI (written with C++ and QT) and (hopefully) CLI components to do very very basic text editing. It may or may not also include a Easter-egg game as well. EASY is an acronym for **E**asy, **A** **S**imply **Y**ucky Text Editor. 
There may be an easter-egg game if you type the string (without quotations): "Kept you waiting, huh?"
